This OpenHW TV episode introduces the new Chair of the OpenHW Verification Task Group and the expanded charter to help support the growing RISC-V Verification Ecosystem.

The OpenHW Group welcomes Simon Davidmann of Imperas Software, a founding member of OpenHW, as the new Chair of the OpenHW Verification Task Group (VTG). As part of the CORE-V roadmap, the VTG is updating the successful CORE-VERIF framework to address both the increasing design complexity and improve the DV efficiency for the anticipated bandwidth required for all the new CORE-V cores in development.

To address the dual goals of improving and enhancing the OpenHW internal flows for the CORE-V roadmap and help lead the industry adoption of RISC-V, and the associated verification workload, the VTG has started a new methodology project. This episode highlights the new OpenHW VTG Advanced RISC-V Verification Methodology (ARVM) project and outlines the initial concepts and plans for a couple of the sub-projects:

- RVM-FunctionalCoverage: developing open-source VIPs that can be used for many different core configurations/implementations

- ARVM-Standards: defining and implementing evolving interface standards (such as RVVI) for test bench components to enable better test bench component reuse and potentially stimulate availability of compatible VIPs

Today's speakers include:

- Simon Davidmann, Chair of OpenHW Verification Task Group and CEO at Imperas Software

- Peter Lewin, Director of CPU Ecosystems at Imagination Technologies

- Rupert Baines, Chief Marketing Officer at Codasip

- Hosted by Mike Thompson, Director of Engineering, Verification Task Group, at OpenHW Group
